A basic flutter application which shows the implementation of Shared Preferences.
It consists of three screens which are Login, Home and the Splash.
The app prompts the user to enter the email (from the reqres API) and the password.
The user makes a post request to reqres api and the app redirects to the Home or Stays in the login as per the response.
The response is then saved in the shared preferences so that when the user opens the app again, it redirects them to either Login or Home page.
